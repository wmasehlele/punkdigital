#instruction
Clone the repository
Change directory to WebContent in the project folder
Run this command: npm install

#tool
->Basic react JS component used for the interface.
->JSX is complied by webpack and loaded by barble.
->npm is used as a package manager.
->Jquery and Bootstrap are used as part of the front end.
->Apache tomcat is used as the sever.

#jars
FileUtils: import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;
JSONObject: import org.json.JSONObject; 

#implementation
->I decided on the basis of efficiency, to have a pre-defined template that is used to build the final image.
 
#issues
->Changes in the project directory are sometimes not published to the server in real time.
-> Due to the focus on solving the provided problem, user friendliness was not the main focus (I hope this is found to be in order).
